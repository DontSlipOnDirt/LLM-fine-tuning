You might ask, \"Why did it rain?\" To answer this question, you need to look at all the things that could have caused the rain, like a storm, a cloud cover, or changes in the weather. Once you find out what caused the rain, you can say that it was because of those things. In statistics and research, we use different methods to find out the causes of events or outcomes, and we call it causal inference.'}]"
